# Standalone_MIPS_Emulator

This project is a C# implementation of a MIPS32R2 CPU.

Very early stages. Only about 65% of the ISA is implemented.

Todo:
- Coprocessor0
- Interrupts
- Virtual memory
- Finish ISA Implementation
- Coprocessor1/Floating point
- Unit Tests for all instructions
- Device I/O
- ELF Loader/firmware
